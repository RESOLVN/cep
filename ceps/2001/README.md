# CEP 2001: Question Formatting and Style Requirements

## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with Question Formatting and Style Requirements for content and assessment modules. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around questions in content and assessment modules, formatting and style. Compliance with this convention facilitates programmatic identification of questions within modules. Following this CEP would be critical to a unified user experience. 

## Specification


### What is a “Question”

A question is a direct question on what must be answered in the Action card field in the SimSpace portal lab event. The answer format itself can change based on the response type. A question should contain the direct instruction for the answer(s).

### Requirements
- Questions must be the last content in a slide to ensure it’s right above the Action card
- Questions must be in heading 2 font type
- Questions must be limited to 250 words max
