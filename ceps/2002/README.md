# CEP 2002: Question Type Requirements

## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with question type rules for assessment modules. 

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize question type rules in assessment modules. If you violate these conventions it will degrade the value of questions in an assessment module. Following this CEP would be critical for accurate user assessment scoring.
