# CEP 2003: Question Point Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with question point rules for assessment modules. 
Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize question points use in assessment modules. If you violate these conventions it will degrade the value of questions in an assessment module. Following this CEP would be critical for accurate user assessment scoring.  

## Specification


### What is a “Question Point”

A question point is the reward value assigned based on the complexity of the task. The requirements below are loosely based on blooms taxonomy? The actual point value is determined by the content author and is intended to allow the use of as many hints that author requires.

### Requirements

*  100 points - recall / knowledge check
    *  This level question tests the analyst's ability to recall a knowledge item.
*  200 points - understand / describe
    *  This level question requires application of knowledge in the use of a tool or data set to derive an answer.
*  300 points - apply / discover
    *  This level question requires application of multiple concepts across one or more data sets and apply academic knowledge or analytical skills to determine the answer.
*  500 points - analyze / evaluate
    *  This level question requires application of multiple concepts across multiple data sets and use critical thinking to determine the answer.
*  1000 points - multi-step / create
    *  This level question requires cumulative mastery of the material and multiple steps.
