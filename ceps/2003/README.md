# CEP 2003: Question Point Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with question point rules for assessment modules. 
Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize question points use in assessment modules. If you violate these conventions it will degrade the value of questions in an assessment module. Following this CEP would be critical for accurate user assessment scoring.  

## Specification


### What is a “Question Point”

A question point is the reward value assigned to the correct answer through the Action card in the content module slide.

### Requirements

* Easy level questions should have a value of 1x point value.
    * An easy question tests the analyst's ability to recall a knowledge item.
* Medium level questions should have a value of 2x point value.
    * The  Medium level question requires application of knowledge in the use of a tool or data set to derive an answer.
* Hard level questions should have a value of 3x point value.
    * The  Hard level question requires application of multiple concepts across one or more data sets and apply academic knowledge or analytical skills to determine the answer.
* Advanced level questions should have a value of 4x point value.
    * The  Advanced level question requires application of multiple concepts across multiple  data sets and use critical thinking to determine the answer.
* A Content Module that is an Assessment must maintain consistent scoring throughout. Whatever score values are used they must follow the basic pattern of the next level question being worth double that of the prior difficulty level for a question. 
    * Example 1: Easy 10 points, Medium 20 points, Hard 30 points, Advanced 40 points.
    * Example 2: Easy 100 points, Medium 200 points, Hard 300 points, Advanced 400 points.
    * The actual point value is determined by the content author and is intended to allow the use of as many hints that author requires.
