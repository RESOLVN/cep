# CEP 2005: Module Introduction Card Requirement


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the module introduction card that is required for training and assessment modules. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around module introduction card that is required for training and assessment modules. If you violate these conventions it will not allow for easy programmatic identification of the Introduction card in modules(and the sections in them) and degrade the value of module. Following this CEP would be critical for a unified user experience.  

## Specification


### What is a “Module Introduction Card”

A “Module Introduction Card” is the first slide in any content module.

### Requirements

* Introduction to the module name and category at the very top of the slide.
* Time to complete in module metadata based on 1 minute per 200 words in a module.
    * 200 words per minute is the average reading speed.
* Must contain a learning objective section (See CEP 2000 for requirement information).
* Must contain a learning outcome section (See CEP 2032 for requirement information).
* Must contain toolkit details (See CEP 2006 for requirement information).
* Title of module must be in heading 1 format.
