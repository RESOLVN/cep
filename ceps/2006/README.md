# CEP 2006: Module Toolkit Requirement


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the toolkit section in the Introduction task for instructional and assessment modules. 

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around the module Introduction task toolkit. Adhering to these conventions allows for easy programmatic validation and ensures a unified user experience.
 
The reason for presenting a toolkit is to contribute to a thorough overview of the module, set expectations for the student and prepare them for what will be used during the course. In most cases, tools will be provided in the cyber range that is associated with the module. It is therefore not necessarily incumbent on the student to provide or obtain the tools listed. 

## Specification

### What is a “Toolkit”

A “Toolkit” is a list of the keywords of technologies that will be used in the module. These include, but are not limited to, utilities, software applications, plug-ins, cloud-based resources, and hardware devices. The toolkit should include any tools specifically being taught in the module, as well as the tools necessary to perform various other instructional and assessment tasks.

As much as possible, use the official or widely adopted or accepted name of a product or technology. In particular, this refers to the use of upper-case and lower-case letters, numerals, symbols and spaces in the name. For commercially branded technologies, refer to the vendor website. For open source technologies, the website may or may not be a useful source, and you may have to make an "executive decision".

While the Toolkit is presented in bulleted list format, it is not necessary to use periods at the end of each item (as is the case with certain other bulleted lists in the Introduction). This is because most toolkit items will be one-, two- or three-word items, without verbs or connecting words.

Use separate bullets for like items. For example, do not group "Command Prompt and PowerShell". Instead, list each as a separate item.

### Requirements

- A module will have a minimum of one (1) toolkit item.
- A toolkit must be included in the Introduction task.
- The toolkit is identified with an H2 title labeled "Toolkit".
- The toolkit is presented in a bulleted list format without periods.
