# CEP 2006: Module Toolkit Requirement


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the module introduction card toolkit requirement section for training and assessment modules. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around the module introduction card toolkit requirement section for training and assessment modules. If you violate these conventions it will not allow for easy programmatic identification of the Introduction card in modules toolkit section and degrade the value of module. Following this CEP would be critical for a unified user experience.
