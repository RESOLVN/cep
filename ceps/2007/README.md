# CEP 2007: Module Image Requirement


## Abstract 

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the module image standards for training and assessment modules. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around images that are included in training and assessment modules. If you violate these conventions it will not allow for easy programmatic identification of the images and degrade the value of module. Following this CEP would be critical for a unified user experience.
