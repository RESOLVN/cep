# CEP 2008: Task Title Requirements

## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the title requirements for tasks within a module. 

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize the structure, format, and content of task titles for information and question task types.

A task title represents the main topic of a given task.

Titles should be about 1-12 words in length. Avoid puns or other creative wording if it obscures the clear meaning of what the task is about. A good litmus test is to consider whether the title could be translated to another language and maintain its meaning, or be readily understood by a user for whom English is a second language.

Avoid punctuation used in programming (\` \$ ' " \& \?  \@ \# \< \> \( \) \{ \} \[ \] \/ \\). The exception is if it part of a proper noun, such as in "ATT&CK".

As with most titles, use 'title case' -- capitalize nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Do not capitalize conjunctions, short prepositions, and articles. 
Here is a [quick resource for title case.](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case)

If you violate these conventions it will impede search, retrieval, and adoption of content modules. Using this CEP is important for a unified user experience.
