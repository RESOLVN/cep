# CEP 2008: Module Title Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the title requirements for content modules of all types. 

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize the structure, format, and content of module titles.

A module title is the name that represents a group of "chains" and "tasks" (the parlance used in the SimSpace Portal when creating content modules) and clearly states the main subject of the module.

The conventions used for a module names often include a project or program name, as well as a numbering scheme decided on by that program. This could be a series of modules created for a specific customer's Capture the Flag (CTF) program, or for a general instructional training program. It is often identified by an acronym. Examples are ELSA (Enterprise Level Security Analyst) or GT (Gunnery Tables). If used as part of the title, a program name and number should precede the subject name.

Titles should be about 1-12 words in length. Avoid puns or other creative wording if it obscures the clear meaning of what the module is about. A good litmus test is to consider whether the title could be translated to another language and maintain its meaning, or be readily understood by a user for whom English is a second language.

Do not use ampersands in place of "and". (It is acceptable to use an ampersand in "ATT&CK".) Avoid a slash in place of "and" and "or". Avoid starting the subject part of a title with a numeral.

As with most titles, use 'title case' -- capitalize nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Do not capitalize conjunctions, short prepositions, and articles.

If you violate these conventions it will impede search, retrieval, and adoption of content modules. Using this CEP is important for a unified user experience.

## Specification

### What is a “Module Title”

The module title is the name that represents the main subject of a group of chains and/or tasks. It may or may not include a program name and/or numbering scheme.

### Requirements

* Use title case.
* Do not use an ampersand within the title.


* If a Module Title has any point value it must declare that information in the content module task title followed by the sequence number “Knowledge Check: #”.
*  If a Module Title has any hands-on range interaction it must declare that information in the content module task title “Hands-On”.


## References and Footnotes

NOTE: Should we have a standard for separating a subject name from program name/number with a punctuation mark such as a colon or dash? Often enough, colons and dashes are used within a title.
