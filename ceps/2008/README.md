# CEP 2008: Module Title Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with the title requirements for content modules of all types. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the structure, format, and content of module titles. If you violate these conventions it will impede search, retrieval, and adoption of content modules. Following this CEP would be critical for a unified user experience.

## Specification


### What is a “Module Title”

The module title is the name that represents a group of Task Chains and Questions. 

Clickpath: Content > Content Modules > “+New Content Module” > [Name]

* If a Module Title has any hands on range interaction it must declare that information in the content module slide title “Hands-On”.
