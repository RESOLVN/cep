# CEP 2009: Module Paragraph Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with paragraph(s) in  training and assessment content modules. 

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure of paragraph(s) in  training and assessment content modules. Adhering to these conventions allows for programmatic validation of the component and maintains the quality and integrity of the module. Following this CEP is critical for a unified user experience and engagement levels.

A paragraph is a single sentence or group of sentences that intentionally starts on a new line. A paragraph discusses a single idea, which sometimes can be conveyed in only one sentence.

Paragraphs should be comprised of about 1-6 sentences. Each sentence should be about 5-30 words in length. In general, sentences should be kept short and to the point.

Within a paragraph, sentences are separated with a single space. Where four or more items are separated by commas, consider using a bulleted list. It depends on the items and the context.

Do not use semicolons, and only rarely a colon, dash or ellipsis. In almost all cases, there are alternatives for those types of punctuation that express the idea more clearly.

Use present verb tense and an active voice.
 No: "If no user is specified, ssh will attempt to..."
 Yes: "If no user is specified, ssh attempts to..."
 No: "It is responsible for bringing together all the hardware..."
 Yes: "It brings together all the hardware..."
 
 Avoid wordiness and superfluous words.
 No: "Simply put, you can easily change the ..."
 Yes: "You can change the ..."
 No: ""
The requirements and suggestions are intended to 

Avoid references to time and amounts that are relative or that don't convey much meaning.
No: "Current versions of Windows ..."
Yes: "Windows 8 and later ..."
No: "Doing such-and-such can take a long time, therefore ..."
Yes: "Doing such-and-such often takes more than two hours, therefore ..."
No: "This is a very useful command."
Yes: "This is a useful command."
