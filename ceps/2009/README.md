# CEP 2009: Module Paragraph Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with included paragraph(s) in  training and assessment content modules. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around included paragraph(s) in  training and assessment content modules. If you violate these conventions it will not allow for easy programmatic identification of the images and degrade the value of module. Following this CEP would be critical for a unified user experience and engagement levels.

## Specification


### What is a “Module Paragraph”

 A “Module Paragraph” is any paragraph within a slide.

### Requirements

*  Paragraph(s) sections in content module slides must not exceed 100 words.
*  Until scaling features allow content to change based on screen size a high level of engagement lower value must become standard.
