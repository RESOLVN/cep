# CEP 2010: Module Code Format and Style Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with code included as text for training and assessment modules. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around code included as text in  training and assessment content module slides. If you violate these conventions it will not allow for easy programmatic identification of the code example(s) and degrade the value of the module. Following this CEP would be critical for a unified user experience and engagement levels.

## Specification


### What is “Module Code”

The “Module Code” is any code related content that is included as text inside the content module slide.

### Requirements
*  All code text must be included in code format sections.
*  Code Example Screenshots may be used to display code as long as the image complies with CEP 2007.
*  Following any code sections in content module slides a blank line must separate any following content sections.
