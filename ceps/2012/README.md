# CEP 2012: Module Length Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents content module lengths semantics and conventions for requirements.

## Rationale

There’s a maximum time investment that any stakeholder can apply to a given content module. Above the upper limit of this threshold, the module should be broken into multiple modules. This consideration also applies to effective assessment design. Content coverage in modules of excessive length may not comply with CEP 2000 Learning Objectives.   

## Specification

### What is “Module length”

The “Module length” is the best practices for length restrictions in a content module.


### Requirements

*  Content Modules should be no longer than 50 total tasks.
*  Content Module tasks should contain less than 1500 words.
*  Content modules should not exceed an estimated duration with respect to the target proficiency level of greater than 1 hour.
