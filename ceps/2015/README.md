# CEP 2015: Module Attachment Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with attachments to modules. 

## Rationale

This aim of this CEP is to specify the file format for attachments, and typical use-cases.

## Specification

Files can be attached to tasks. The preferred format is PDF, although PNG is acceptable. The latter might be more typical for a network diagram that originated in an illustration program. Do not use propietary formats, such as .docx for Microsoft Word.

Attachments can provide added value to your module. For example, a so-called cheat sheet could provide a list of commonly-used syntax options that would be a useful resource apart from the module. You could also attach documentation (provided it is freely available) that may not be strictly necessary for the module, but is optional self-study. Any such resources that you create yourself should be proofread by colleagues. Resources that use images to represent devices, arrows, flow charts or other such components should be done in consultation with a staff illustrator to ensure they meet graphical standards.

In challenge modules, all attachments should be available in all tasks, except for the introductory task. This eliminates the need for the user to interrupt their flow by searching through tasks for a needed resource.

In instructional modules, attach only the documents that are necessary for a given task. If a document is necessary for more than one task, attach it to each one.

If you make a reference in the task to the attachment, indicate that it is available in the "Documents panel". It is not necessary to provide further directional information.

### Requirements

Attachments must use the file format PDF or PNG.
