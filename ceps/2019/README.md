# CEP 2019: Content Cheat Sheet Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics and conventions for so-called cheat sheet as attachments to modules.

## Rationale

Using this standard helps create a consistent user experience and appearance. Cheat sheets that have the same general design/style/format help set user expectations, present a professional image and contribute to the company brand.

Cheat sheets use PDF format. This facilitates the copy/paste of text, especially command lines.

Cheat sheets can take on a life of their own, being printed out, saved locally or shared. Therefore, be sure to include information about the version of the item it refers to.

## Specification

### Requirements

*  Cheat sheets must be attached in the introduction task.
*  Cheat sheets should be in PDF format.
*  Cheat sheets should include version numbers and author information.
