# CEP 2032: Content Learning Outcome Requirements
 
## Abstract

This CEP documents the requirements for and use of Learning Outcomes in addition to the existence of Learning Objectives. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure of learning outcomes required for training and assessment content module slides. If you violate these conventions it will not allow for easy programmatic identification of the learning outcomes and degrade the value of the module. Compliance with this CEP is required to maintain a consistent learner data footprint for meaningful assessment. 

## Specification

### What is a “Learning Outcome”

A “Learning Outcome” is a statement in the title slide of a content module of the 3 learning outcomes a student should expect to do in practice upon completion of the module. Learning Outcomes shall exist in parallel to Learning Objectives and may be best represented in table form. 

**Learning Objectives**
*  Identify what the participant is supposed to know;
*  Often written from the perspective of the author, educator, or event manager. 
*  Descriptive titles that bundle related skills (e.g. “chapter” level)?

**Learning Outcomes:**
*  Identify what the participant is supposed to do;
*  Serves as a basis of comparison for assessment and evaluation.

### Requirements

*  3 Learning Outcomes are required.
*  Learning Outcomes  must be in a heading 3 font and be titled "Learning Outcomes:"
*  The 3 Learning Outcomes should be in bullet format.
*  No punctuation should be used in the 3 points.
