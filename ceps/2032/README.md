# CEP 2032: Content Learning Outcome Requirements
 
## Abstract

This CEP documents the requirements for and use of Learning Outcomes for an instructional content module. 

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to define "learning objective" and its structure, and to standardize the presentation format and style for learning outcomes required for instructional content modules.  

Learning outcomes express what the student should or will be able to do upon completion of the module. This is expressed using measurable or observable verbs or terms. (The use of terms such as "will understand" or "will know" do not meet this criteria.) The importance of properly written Outcomes is essential to the development and integrity of a module. Therefore this section goes into more detail than may be found in other CEPs. 

Learning outcomes and learning objectives are sometimes used interchangeably, but as implemented here, they are distinctive. With outcomes, the focus is on doing. Objectives serve as a list of what the module intends to teach. 

This CEP uses the Bloom's Taxonomy framework as a guide. Bloom's commonly uses the term "learning objective" for what SimSpace modules refer to as _Learning Outcomes_, hence the need to distinguish the two terms. For this CEP, the use of Bloom's framework applies to SimSpace's learning outcomes.

In addition to Bloom's, this CEP and its use of the term "learning outcomes" has also been informed by sources such as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity
Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework; the International Training and Education Center for Health (go2itech.org) Training Toolkit; and the US Army Learning Concept for Training and Education 2020-2040.

Learning outcomes form the basis of a module's content and organizational structure, and should therefore be written _before_ the instructional content and any assessment questions.

The key to writing outcomes is the use of verbs. Bloom's Taxonomy is often used as a resource for "action" verbs, such as identify, explain, use, compare, prepare or design. Bloom's, however, is more than verbs; it is a framework for developing learning based on the cognitive processes that learners encounter. As such, certain verbs are associated with lower order cognitive processes and others with higher order processes. Rather than randomly selecting verbs, it's worthwhile to consider where the knowledge check questions may fall on this continuum and choose your verbs accordingly. Ideally, this continuum also aligns with the sequence of questions within the module, with lower order questions occuring first.

Outcomes must assess performance-related knowledge, skills and abilities and not merely a student's ability to use a tool. For example, to use a command window to obtain an IP address assesses the ability to use a command window. Alternatively, using the ipconfig command to determine the IP address assesses the ability to use the appropriate command to obtain a specific piece of information.

Using stringently written learning outcomes serves multiple purposes:
- They enable the content producer to validate their content.
- They allow the student and their sponsor to determine what is to be taught and how effective it was.
- They serve as the basis for development of knowledge checks.
- By being displayed at the start of a module, they set expectations and help to instill confidence.

The bottom line is that they validate the integrity of the module -- that the learner will be able to do what the outcomes say they will be able to do.

Outcomes are presented in a bulleted list format and use periods at the end even if each is not a complete sentence. The use of a period is subjective, but it is based on the idea that a period completes a thought or idea. A lead-in sentence to the list is not required because the heading speaks for itself.  

Compliance with this convention facilitates programmatic identification of outcomes within modules. Adhering to this CEP is critical to a unified user experience.

## Specification

### What is a “Learning Outcome”

A “Learning Outcome” is one or more statements in the Introduction task of a content module that state what the student is expected to be able to do upon completion of the module.

### Requirements

- A module will have a minimum of three (3) learning outcomes.
- Outcomes must be included in the Introduction task.
- Outcomes are identified with an H3 title labeled "Learning Outcomes".
- Outcomes are presented in a bulleted list format.
- Each outcome ends with a period.
- Each outcome has a maximum of 120 characters.
- Each outcome must include a verb that is observable or demonstrable.
