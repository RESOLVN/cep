# CEP 2035: Performance Reporting Requirements

 
## Abstract

This CEP documents the semantics, syntax and conventions associated with performance reporting for individual and team-based assessments. 

## Rationale

This AIM of this CEP is to standardize the high-level structure around performance reporting for individual and team-based assessment. Violation of these conventions will skew representation of performance to participants and stakeholders. Following this CEP is critical for a consistent and efficacious learner data footprint.  

## Specification

### Requirements

* Performance criteria shall be applied equally to individual and team-based assessments. 
* Aggregated performance thresholds include:
    * ≥ 60% is “Competency”; a synonym for “Readiness.’
    * ≥ 75% is “Proficiency”.
    * ≥ 90% is “Mastery”.
