# CEP 2036: Knowledge Check Requirements


## Abstract

This CEP documents the requirement to include "knowledge check" or "check on learning" questions within modules that have a primary instructional focus rather than an assessment focus.

## Rationale

The aim of this CEP is to enforce the inclusion of this instructional design best practice. 

The purpose of knowledge checks in SimSpace modules is to assess how well the student is doing by seeking responses to questions or instructions, and using point values which count toward an overall score. While knowledge checks may provide reinforcement of concepts and a means of self-assessment, their primary purpose is to assess the student's learning.

Because the author- and user-facing interfaces use the label "question", questions should be phrased in such a way that they use a question mark. This is a strict interpretation of the term, and a label such as "knowledge check" would allow for more flexibility. Further, because each question exists as a standalone task (as opposed to a group), it is necessary to include instruction for how to answer the question as part of the question structure. Such an instruction can be a separate sentence or incorporated into the question sentence. Do not assume it is apparent or intuitive what the student needs to do. Here is an example:
This is not a question: Choose the sentence below that best defines a widget.
This is a question: Which sentence below best defines a widget? Choose one.
Alternatively: What is a widget? Choose the best answer from the list below.

## Specification

## Requirements

*  No more than an estimated 10 minutes of reading and un-assessed exercise should be included without a pause for check-on-learning.
    *  At least 1 question every 10 minutes.
