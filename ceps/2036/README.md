# CEP 2036: Knowledge Checks, Instructional, Amount

## Abstract

This CEP documents the number of "knowledge checks" to include within modules that have a primary instructional focus (as opposed to an assessment/CTF focus). (For information about the knowledge checks formatting, use of retries, hints and point values, refer to related knowledge check CEPs.)

## Rationale

By providing guidelines of the number of knowledge checks within a module, the aim of this CEP is to enforce an instructional design best practice for providing quality learning and assessment, and to maintain a consistent experience for the user across modules. 

The SimSpace Portal interfaces use the label "question", which, if strictly interpreted, requires phrasing that uses a question mark. Using the term "knowledge check" allows for more flexibility.

The purpose of knowledge checks in SimSpace modules is to assess whether the user has achieved the Learning Outcomes by seeking responses to "assignments", and applying a point value which counts toward an overall module score. (While knowledge checks may also provide reinforcement of concepts and a means of self-assessment, their primary purpose is to assess the student's learning.)

Minimally, there should be a knowledge check for each Learning Outcome. Ideally, there will be two knowledge checks for each Learning Outcome, addressing different categories of the cognitive process (per the widely-used Bloom's Taxonomy, these are labeled as Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate and Create).

The use of three or more knowledge checks for a given Learning Outcome may be used in the following circumstances:
* To align with the level of the difficulty of the module (intermediate or advanced sections of an instructional program), with each knowledge check addressing a different cognitive category.
* In any level module where application of a formula, procedure or process may be prone to error by user's who have not yet mastered it.

Knowledge checks should occur at the conclusion of a topic that aligns with the Topics list in the Introduction task. If a topic is lengthy and/or includes multiple concepts or sub-topics, it is suggested to have not more than one knowledge check between each sub-topic. This provides the user with a brief opportunity for assessment and review before moving on to a new related topic. Too many knowledge checks at this point, however, may interrupt the user's learning flow.

## Specification

## Requirements

- A minimum of one knowledge check for each Learning Outcome.
    - Two knowledge checks is preferred.
