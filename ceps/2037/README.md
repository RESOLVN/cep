# CEP 2037: Citations and References


## Abstract

This CEP documents the requirement to format citations and references that are included in a module.
It does not specify requirements for linking.

## Rationale

For consistency and professionalism, citing various types of documents and sources should be formatted according to a
 standard.
This also helps authors and editors include all the proper and relevant information for any single citation or
 reference. 

## Specification

The IEEE Citation Reference is our source of authority for formatting citations and references.

## Requirements

All external references to documents, web pages (unlinked), printed materials, periodicals, reports, etc. in module
 text or in attached documents are formatted as per IEEE Citation Reference Guide according to the type of media or
  document being referenced.
